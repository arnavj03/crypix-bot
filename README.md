## Getting Started

Please run the exe file so that the program can run at its full potential. Because there are some external modules used and unless installed they won't work in python. The python file is just to check the coding.

-How to download the exe?
1) Click this Mediafire link and click download.

http://www.mediafire.com/file/0y2p6k51d3r3eev/crypix+(+arnav+,+asad+,+arpit+).exe/file

2) Chrome will detect it as a virus but it's not. To fix it click the 3 dots on the top right corner, go to downloads and click allow the file to download.

3) Please make sure all antivirus including the windows defender are disabled because they auto-delete the file. They detect it as a virus because it has not been certified by Google.
